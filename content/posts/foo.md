That’s setting a very high bar, and, for now, I’m not sure Alyx clears it. The
game is fighting VR’s inherent hardware limits, a pandemic-related headset
shortage, and the difficulty of building a game for a new platform. While it’s
about as long as the landmark Half-Life 2, with my game clocking in at 15
hours, it doesn’t feel as big or as narratively and mechanically fresh. It
advances the series’s main plot, but it doesn’t come close to resolving it.
