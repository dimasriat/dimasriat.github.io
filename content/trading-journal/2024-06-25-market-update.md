Currently, altcoins are very good to be LONG-ed. BTC.Dominance is very ideal to
support the LONG setup for alts. Need to maintain and follow up the price
action for the alts. Some of it also have showing the good entry oportunity.

The most important thing is that for the risk management, should not be set to
high right now. I still playing with the conservative risk, around 0.5% - 0.75%
per trade I enter. 

One of the reason is because the BTC which still being under pressure. We never
know when the market will reverse BTC because of the BTC.D. For now we respond
to the market first by utilizing the current reversal moment.
