# Hi there! I am Dimas

A software dev, web3 enthusiast and open source contributor.

If you're new to my website I suggest exploring my articles or my career log as they give context to how I became who I am today. If you remain, welcome aboard, space pirate.

## Why?

For some context, the purpose of this is to both act as:
1. A public record to keep me on track w/ my commitments and for reflection
2. An inspiration to those wondering how I got to where I am. I would sure love to read other autobiographies :(

## Foreword

My focus is to be at the intersection of `software, crypto, finance and maths`.

I hope you enjoy reading about my life :)
